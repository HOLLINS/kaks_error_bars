**Requirements / How to use**

For this delicious dish, You WILL need the following ingredients: 

 1. A pair of DNA sequences in a format that KaKs calculator accepts (e.g. ./example_kaks_calc_output.txt) 

 2. The KaKs calculator (read installation instructions: https://code.google.com/archive/p/kaks-calculator/), it's output data is what this R script needs for error bars

You MIGHT also need:

 1. Windows (OR ubuntu)

 2. RStudio IDE, it's free (I have not used on any other IDE, maybe you don't need)

 3. Latest version of R (Only tested on 2014+ versions)

You need to then follow this recipe: 

 1. Run the KaKs calculator (https://code.google.com/archive/p/kaks-calculator/), read the instructions and give the DNA sequences it needs

 2. Run this R script (./plot_kaks_err_bars.R), it will then prompt you for a data file (next step)

 3. Browse for your KaKs calculator output file, select it then click. There might be several output files, so here I have an example data file that you can use as a reference, it SHOULD work: ./example_kaks_calc_output.txt

 4. All done! The plot can be shown interactively, or uncomment CTRL+F: "@PLOT" line in the script to save to .PNG file kaks_error_bars

 If you find that something does not work, or you see a conceptual issue with the code please do not hesitate to make a message on the GitHub repo.
